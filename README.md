<h1 align="center">Youtube AdAway</h1>

We created this tool with a simple mission: make your YouTube watching smoother while still supporting the creators we all love. YouTube's policies are tough on ad blockers, so instead, we find those ads and skip them for you. It's a win-win - the ads are there, but they won't get in your way.

## :sparkles: Features

**Comprehensive Ad Removal**

YouTube AdAway removes all forms of advertisements on YouTube, ensuring an uninterrupted viewing experience—even on videos with non-skippable ads.

**AutoSkipping Toggle**

We empower users with the choice to control auto-skipping of ads. With a simple press of the **q** key, you can manually skip ads whenever you prefer, when the auto-skip feature is turned off.

**Optimized Performance**

- **Clear & Structured Code:** Crafted for simplicity and ease of maintenance, our software welcomes both curious minds and contributing developers.
- **Efficient DOM Monitoring:** Utilizing MutationObserver, we provide a modern and streamlined approach to instantly detect webpage changes, ensuring top-notch performance without unnecessary workload.
- **Responsive and Event-Driven:** Operating quietly in the background, our script conserves resources and ensures a seamless user experience, springing into action only when needed.
